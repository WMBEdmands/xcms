* Overview of new and modified functionality in =xcms=

Thus far this is more to remind me what has been added/changed. In the end it
would be nice to have a vignette describing all these methods in detail.

** Binning functions

The binning/profile matrix generation functions have been completely
rewritten. The new =binYonX= function replaces =profBin=, =profBinLin= and
=profBinLinBase= methods. The function provides also additional functionality:

+ Breaks for the bins can be defined based on either the number of desired bins
  (=nBins=) or the size of a bin (=binSize=). In addition it is possible to provide
  a vector with pre-defined breaks. This allows to bin data from multiple files
  or scans on the same bin-definition.

+ The function returns a list with element =y= containing the binned values and
  element =x= the bin mid-points.

+ Values in input vector =y= can be aggregated within each bin with different
  methods: =max=, =min=, =sum= and =mean=.
