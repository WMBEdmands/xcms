* The =xcms3= package

The =xcms3= package is an updated and partially re-written version of the =xcms=
package. The version /3/ was selected to avoid confusions with the /xcms2/
(http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac800795f) software. While providing all
of the original software's functionality, =xcms3= aims at:

1) Better integration into the Bioconductor framework:
  - Make use and extend classes defined in the =MSnbase= package.
  - Implement class versioning (Biobase's =Versioned= class).
  - Use =BiocParallel= for parallel processing.
2) Implementation of validation methods for all classes to ensure data
   integrity.
3) Easier and faster access to raw spectra data.
4) Cleanup of the source code:
  - Remove obsolete and redundant functionality (=getEIC=, =rawEIC= etc).
  - Unify interfaces, i.e. implement a layer of base functions accessing all
    analysis methods (which are implemented in C, C++ or R).
5) Using a more consistent naming scheme of methods that follows established
   naming conventions (e.g. =correspondence= instead of =grouping=).
6) Update, improve and extend the documentation.
7) Establishing a layer of base R-functions that interface all analysis
   methods. These should take M/Z, retention time (or scan index) and intensity
   values as input along with optional arguments for the downstream functions
   (implemented in C, C++ or R). The input arguments should be basic R objects
   (numeric vectors) thus enabling easy integration of analysis methods in other
   R packages.
8) The user interface's analysis methods should take the (raw) data object and a
   parameter class, that is used for dispatching to the corresponding analysis
   algorithm.
